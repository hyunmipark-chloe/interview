			<h4>Why do you want to be a designer?</h4>
			<p> I think that all products that humans make and invent should be visually beautiful as God had created the world and all creatures beautifully, and it is our instinct to desire beauty. In terms of this, working as a designer is more valuable and attractive jobs than others. Personally, I like to organize and analyze everything that is shown visually, which are colours, fonts, and even items in my bag. For these reasons, I've never thought of other jobs than a designer.</p>

			<h4>What is the main reason why you chose graphic design?</h4>
			<p>At first, I thought it was just making advertisements or posters, and I chose graphic design just because I wanted to make a nice poster. However, I noticed graphic design to be the most fundamental and comprehensive design, not simply making posters or brochures. I am so proud of my choice and pleasant to learn. Over a decade, with the growth of the Internet and mobile market and the shrinking print market, more departments are emphasizing technical aspects. However, I believe that graphic design is the most essential and important part of a design that can be applied in all areas with graphic design principles and theories rather than technology, and it can expand to a wider design area.</p>

			<h4>What is the most important point in the design?</h4>
			<p>I think the most important thing is thinking about why I do this design. For example, profit, communication, convenience, and new experience. Through design, I think about the goals that should be drawn, and how to design in order to achieve those goals.</p>
